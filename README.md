Oracle APEX - Template Effects

## About

This is a simple CSS Library that aims to extend some of Oracle APEX's Vita Theme with additional animations and effects.

## How to use it

Just download the CSS file in the CSS Download Folder and add it to your Static Application/Workspace Files and link it in the User Interface or at the CSS links at the page level.

You should not have to add any specific classes or change the template; it's simply link and run.

## Support

Currently, this library has only been tested on Oracle APEX 23.2.

You may get good results on older versions, but testing would be advised.

## Disclaimer

This is a work in progress. We'll do our best to test and review everything, but please keep in mind that you might need to adjust things if a critical issue appears.
